### What is Baseline Guardian?

A GitHub Action that enforces modern web standards before they hit production. It automatically scans CSS files in pull requests for browser compatibility issues using the official web-features baseline data.

### Features

- ‚ö° **Fast & Lightweight** - Runs in Node.js 20

### Quick Start

Add this workflow to your repository:

\`\`\`yaml
name: 'Baseline Guardian'

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
  checks: write

jobs:
  run-guardian:
    name: Run Baseline Guardian
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run Baseline Guardian
        uses: MdRaf1/baseline-guardian@v1.0.0

## üîÑ Future Updates

When you want to release updates:

1. Make your changes and commit them
2. Build the action: `npm run build`
3. Commit the updated `dist/` folder
4. Create and push a new tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.1
   git push origin v1.0.1
   ```
5. The automated release workflow will:
   - Run tests
   - Create a GitHub release
   - Update the marketplace listing automatically
   - Update the major version tag (v1)

## üè∑Ô∏è Version Management

### Major Version Tags

Keep major version tags updated for easy adoption:

```bash
# After releasing v1.0.1, update v1 tag
git tag -fa v1 -m "Update v1 to v1.0.1"
git push origin v1 --force
```

Users can then reference `@v1` in their workflows, which always points to the latest v1.x.x release.

### Semantic Versioning

Follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/):
- **Major (v2.0.0)**: Breaking changes
- **Minor (v1.1.0)**: New features, backwards compatible
- **Patch (v1.0.1)**: Bug fixes, backwards compatible
